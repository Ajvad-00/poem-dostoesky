"The Weight of the Soul"
— Inspired by Dostoevsky

In alleys dark where silence grows,
A man walks slow, the city knows.
His shadow bends beneath the light,
He bears the weight of wrong and right.

He asks not God for peace or grace,
But stares into his own pale face—
Reflected in a broken pane,
A thousand shards of guilt and pain.

The truth, he knows, is never pure,
And virtue’s rarely found in poor.
The saints are weak, the sinners cry,
And even love can twist and lie.

A whisper lingers in the air:
"Am I a beast, or just aware?"
His hands once clean, now stained with doubt,
He can’t let pain or hope burn out.

For what is man, if not a war—
Between the cage and something more?
Between the crime, the cost, the plea,
The cell, the cross, eternity.
